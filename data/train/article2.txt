Congress leader Shashi Tharoor today apologised for getting some of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's views on the Bangladesh war wrong. He admitted his mistake saying it was based on the "quick reading" of headlines and tweeted "sorry". The Thiruvananthapuram MP's post came a day after he posted another one implying that PM Modi had not acknowledged former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's role in the liberation of the eastern wing of what was united Pakistan till 1971.
"I don't mind admitting when I'm wrong," Mr Tharoor wrote in the tweet today.


Yesterday he had posted a tweet with the remarks, "International education: our PM is giving Bangladesh a taste of Indian 'fake news'. The absurdity is that everyone knows who liberated Bangladesh."

His tweet was based on a news report which quoted PM Modi as saying that he had held a Satyagraha for Bangladesh's liberation and had been even jailed for it.


"I was 20-22 years old when I, along with my friends, did Satyagrah for the freedom of Bangladesh. I had even been arrested for the same," the Prime Minister said during his speech in Dhaka on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the nation.

Others, too, picked on the Prime Minister's statement.
